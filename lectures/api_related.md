## When one software wants to use the features or data of another software, it uses an API to request that functionality.

## Using Other Companies’ APIs

* When we want to use the services of other platforms (like **Google Maps**, **JazzCash**, etc.), we use their **public APIs**.
* Example:

  * To display maps, we use **Google Maps API**.
  * To make payments, we use **JazzCash API**.

### API Usage Limits and Costs

* Many APIs are **free up to a limit** (called a *free tier*).
* If we **use them beyond that limit**, we need to **pay** for additional usage.

## Selling Your Own API

* Just like we use others’ APIs, we can also **create and sell our own APIs**.
* Example:

  * If you develop an API that provides currency exchange data, others can **use your API** by making requests to it.
   * If you only provide the **API service**, users pay based on usage.
