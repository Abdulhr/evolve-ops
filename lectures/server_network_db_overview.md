# Server, Networking, and Database Concepts Overview

## Server Side

* The **server** contains the **business logic**, which defines how data is processed, validated, and saved.
* This logic interacts directly with the **database** to **store**, **update**, and **retrieve** information.
* Example:

  * When a user submits a form on the frontend, the server processes the data and saves it into the database.

---

## Frontend (Client Side)

* The **frontend** displays the user interface (buttons, forms, tables, etc.).
* Users interact with the app through these components to perform actions like submitting data or viewing results.
* Example:

  * A “Save” button on the frontend triggers a **request** to the backend to store data.

## 🌐 Connecting Between Computers

* To communicate between computers or systems, we use **IP addresses**.



*  **3000** is the **port number**, which identifies a specific application or service running on your machine.

---

## 🔒 Secure Connections

* URLs beginning with **`https://`** indicate that the communication between the client and server is **secure** (encrypted using SSL/TLS).
* Example:

  * `http://example.com` → Not secure
  * `https://example.com` → Secure (encrypted)

---

## 🗄️ Database and Ports

* Every database or service listens on a **specific port number**.


---

## Conventions and Clarity

* We use **conventional naming and port numbers** to **avoid ambiguity** and **ensure consistency** across systems.
